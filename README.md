##Main Technical Features are listed as follows:
- React, React Router, and Flux for ultra-responsive UI development  
- Browserify bundling  
- jQuery with Bootstrap for styling  
- Gulp build that:  
-- compiles JSX  
-- lints JSX and JS via ESLint  
-- bundles JS and CSS files  
-- migrates the built app to the dist folder  
-- runs a dev webserver  
-- opens your browser at the dev URL  
-- reloads the browser upon save
